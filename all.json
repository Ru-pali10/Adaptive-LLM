These counters can help you analyze the performance and behavior of your system during the execution of your code.\n\nOne common counter that can be used to detect interleaved attacks is the \"Instructions Retired\" counter. This counter measures the total number of instructions that have been retired by the processor. During an interleaved attack, there may be unexpected changes in the instruction flow or an increase in the number of instructions executed that can be captured by monitoring this counter.\n\nI will now assist you in performing a bimodal test on the \"Instructions Retired\" counter data to check for any abnormalities that could indicate an interleaved attack. Let's proceed with analyzing the data."

Here are some potential perfmon event counters that may be helpful in this context:\n\n1. **IDQ_UOPS_NOT_DELIVERED.CORE**: Counts the number of Uops not delivered by the front end.\n\n2. **INT_MISC.RECOVERY_CYCLES**: Counts the number of cycles that the machine is recovering from previous mispredictions or interruptions.\n\n3. **CYCLES_ACTIVITY.CYCLES_NO_EXECUTE**: Counts the number of cycles where no instructions are executed.\n\n4. **MACHINE_CLEARS.SMC**: Counts the occurrences of Self-Modifying Code, which might trigger speculative execution vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **MACHINE_CLEARS.MEMORY_ORDERING**: Tracks machine clears due to memory ordering issues, potentially indicating mis-speculation.\n\n6. **MACHINE_CLEARS.MASKMOV**: Counts machine clears due to mask move operations.\n\n7. **RESOURCE_STALLS.RS**: Counts the number of cycles stalled due to resource-related reasons, possibly indicating speculative execution issues.\n\nThese counters can be monitored using Intel's VTune Profiler or other performance monitoring tools that support perfmon events on Intel processors. Monitoring these counters may help in understanding and detecting potential speculative execution vulnerabilities triggered by Cross-Modifying Code scenarios."
